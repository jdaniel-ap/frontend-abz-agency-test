  # HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) - Forces HTTPS for 1 year

  # X-Frame-Options - Prevents clickjacking attacks (SAMEORIGIN allows your own frames)
  # Use DENY for total protection, but SAMEORIGIN is better for React apps with modals/iframes
  X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
  
  # X-XSS-Protection - Disabled as recommended by security experts (deprecated header)
  X-XSS-Protection: 0
  
  # X-Content-Type-Options - Prevents MIME type sniffing attacks
  X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  
  # Content Security Policy - Allows inline scripts/styles for React/Vite apps
  # Matches the WordPress article recommendation but adapted for modern SPA
